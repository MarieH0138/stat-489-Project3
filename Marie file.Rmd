Predicting if QB "the team" tends to do some type of passing: deep, short, left or right. 
And if they are successful or not

Idea -> prediction model looking something like: 


model <- glm*/lm*(Final_position~starting_coordinates+initial_speed+initial_heading+position , data = train, family = "poisson")


logistic_cv2 <- cv.glm(train, model, cost, K=5)
logistic_cv2$delta


To get to this point I need to:
-decide what variables to use
-how to code those variables
-clean the data to remove the stupid variables HAH
-more cleaning. boo. 
- data exploration
-decide on a model that looks noice
-graphical representations
-see what the homies think about it 
-make it work. sigh
